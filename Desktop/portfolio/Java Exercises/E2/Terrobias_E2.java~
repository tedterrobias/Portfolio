5.17 (Calculating Sales) An online retailer sells five products whose retail prices are as follows:
Product 1, $2.98; product 2, $4.50; product 3, $9.98; product 4, $4.49 and product 5, $6.87.
Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
a) product number
b) quantity sold
Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product. It
should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold. Use a sentinel-controlled
loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.

ALGORITHM:
1. intialize the variables to be used in the program
2. ask input from the user
